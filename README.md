<h1 align="center">I'm Adam Poonah!</h1>
<h3 align="center">Passionate Fourth-Year Electrical Engineering Student with an Interest in Power Systems and Power Electronics</h3>

**âš¡ Iâ€™m currently working on a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)**
- Developing a +/-12V dual-rail power supply from a mains voltage wall adapter.
- Developing saw-tooth waveforms complying with 1V/Octave standard using a Schmitt trigger and diodes.
- Using waveshaping circuits to convert from sawtooth to square, and then to sine, utilizing non-inverting op-amps.

**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in High Voltage and Low Voltage Systems**
- My previous experience includes working on various high voltage projects, such as 27.6kV distribution systems, 600V:120/208V transformers, and up to 5000V cables.
- Labs and personal projects have provided me with low voltage experience, such as a DC-DC power supply, embedded systems, and power electronics.

**ðŸ”‹ I'm currently an intern at Smith + Andersen as a Junior Electrical Designer**
- Working on an EV Charging project to deploy over 450+ stations to a residential parking lot.
- Utilizing the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (OESC) for cable calculations, breaker and fuse sizing, and panel selection.
- Involved in transformer replacement projects up to 3000/4000kVA, 3-phase, 4-wire, 600V:120/208V.
- Conducting power studies for various buildings, from high voltage switchgear all the way to mechanical loads.

**ðŸ’¼ Previous Intern at Toronto Hydro**
- Conducted various load analyses for Toronto's 13.8kV overhead and underground feeder systems.
- Completed feeder requests up to 5MVA of power for commercial buildings.
