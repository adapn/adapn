<h1 align="center">I'm Adam Poonah!</h1>
<h3 align="center">Passionate Fourth-Year Electrical Engineering Student with an Interest on Power Systems and Power Electronics</h3>

 
 **âš¡Iâ€™m currently working on a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)**
  - Currently developing a +/-12V dual-rail power supply from a mains voltage wall adapter.
  - Develope a saw-tooth waveforms complying with 1V/Octive standard using a Schmitt trigger a diodes.
  - Use waveshaping circuits to go from sawtooth to square, and then to sine utilizing non-inverting op-amps.

**ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m intersted in High Voltage and Low Voltage Systems**
  - My previous experience has allowed me to work on various high voltage projects, such as 27.kV distribution systems, 600V:120/208V transformers, and up to 5000V Cables.
  - Labs and personal projects have provided me with low voltage experience such as a DC-DC power supply, embeeded systems and power electronics.

**ðŸ”‹ I'm currently an intern at Smith + Andersen as a Junior Electrical Designer**
   - EV Charging project to deply over 450+ stations to a residential parking lot.
   - Utilized OESC for cable calculations, breaker and fuse sizing and panel selection.
   - Transformer replacement projects up to 3000/4000kVA, 3ph 4W, 600V:120/208V.
   - Power studies for various buildings, from the high voltage switchgear all the way to mechanical loads.

**ðŸ’¼Previous intern at Toronot Hydro**
  - Conducted various load analysis for Toronto's 13.8kV overhead and underground feeder system.
  - Completed feeder request up to 5MVA of power for commercial buildings.
